This project is intended to be used with the

able to follow it by yourself.

dependencies:

```sh

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:
configure hardhat-config.ts file to work on arbitrum sepolia testnet

```sh

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to compile and then
deploy your contract:

```
